\begin{abstract}
With the ever-increasing amount of data stored and processed and ever-evolving hardware technology, there is not only an ongoing need for testing database management systems but also data-intensive systems in general.
%Furthermore, emerging new technologies such as Non-Volatile Memory impose new challenges (e.g., avoiding persistent memory leaks and partial writes), and novel system designs targeting FPGAs, GPUs, and RDMA call for additional attention and sophistication to testing.
Reviving the previous success of the nine previous workshops, the goal of DBTest 2024 is to bring researchers and practitioners from academia and industry together to discuss key problems and ideas related to testing database systems and applications. The long-term objective is to reduce the cost and time required to test and tune data management and processing products so that users and vendors can spend more time and energy on actual innovations.

\section{Workshop Motivation and Scope}
We are running the 10th instance of the Workshop on Testing Database Systems (DBTest) at SIGMOD
2024. After four years of absence, DBTest was successfully revived at SIGMOD 2018, with over 40
participants, 15 paper submissions (out of which 8 were accepted), and three industry sponsors (SAP,
Snowflake, Undo). Like previous instances, one of the remarkable aspects was the high number of industry
participants and submissions, creating an interesting mix of both academic work and industry
perspectives.

After deciding to revive DBTest, we got a lot of positive feedback and were encouraged by the audience
to re-establish DBTest in a yearly cadence. However, in order to not repeat past mistakes and as
announced in the 2018 workshop application, we decided to only run with a biannual cadence to prevent
from running out of topics and high-quality submissions. As a result, we applied and held the 8th instance
for the DBTest workshop in 2020 in virtual format due to the pandemic with 10 submissions in total (out
of which 5 were accepted as full paper and 2 were accepted as short poster papers). We think the slightly
lower number of submissions were due to the impact of the start of the pandemic on people. Despite this
we received very high-quality submissions, and the workshop once again had a good mix of both academic
and industry participants and presenters. In total, we had 150 registrants, and the three sessions had 72,
57, and 48 participants, respectively. In 2022, we held DBTest in a hybrid mode. We had a relatively low
number of 5 submissions. However, during the workshop, 15--35 attendees participated in-person, while
15--25 participated online, and the discussion and Q/A sessions were highly interactive. Since then, we
have noticed an increased interest in the workshop’s topic, such as shown by, for example, a Dagstuhl
seminar on “Ensuring the Reliability and Robustness of Database Management Systems” held in
October/November 2023. As part of the seminar, around 40 researchers and practitioners came together
and discussed challenges and ways forward. As another example, a SIGMOD 2023 best paper award was
given to a DBMS testing work, demonstrating the increased importance of the area. Overall, we were motivated to propose another instance of the workshop.

We believe that there is the need and interest for discussing topics that are related to not only testing
database management systems but also data-intensive systems in general. Over the last few years, we
have seen an increase in academic and industry work focusing on benchmarking and performance
evaluation in novel cloud settings, driven both by an increase and diversity in workloads as well as
hardware such as FPGAs or GPUs. Moreover, there are new classes of data-driven applications (i.e.,
machine learning and big data scenarios) that need to be considered. At the same time, SQL and no-SQL
engines alike are developing, and new engine concepts such unified engines are being created.
Consequentially, they require special testing efforts and rigor to ensure classical database strengths such
as reliability, integrity, and performance can be successfully carried over to these novel system
architectures and designs.

\section{Topics of Interest}
The workshop focuses on the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reproducibility of database research (new!)
	\item Testing and benchmarking of learning-based database systems (new!)
	\item Testing of database systems, storage services, and database applications
	\item Testing of database systems using novel hardware and software technology (non-volatile memory, hardware transactional memory, …)
	\item Testing heterogeneous systems with hardware accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, …)
	\item Testing distributed and big data systems
	\item Testing machine learning systems
	\item Specific challenges of testing and quality assurance for cloud-based systems
	\item War stories and lessons learned
	\item Performance and scalability testing
	\item Testing the reliability and availability of database systems
	\item Algorithms and techniques for automatic program verification
	\item Maximizing code coverage during testing of database systems and applications
	\item Generation of synthetic data for test databases
	\item Testing the effectiveness of adaptive policies and components
	\item Tools for analyzing database management systems (e.g., profilers, debuggers)
	\item Workload characterization with respect to performance metrics and engine components
	\item Metrics for test quality, robustness, efficiency, and effectiveness
	\item Operational aspects such as continuous integration and delivery pipelines
	\item Security and vulnerability testing

\section{Keynote Speakers}
% http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/about/bio_ShanLu.html
\textbf{Everett (Ev) Maus (Staff Software Engineer, Google)}

Ev has a passion for teaching computers to find bugs --- ideally without making other developers too unhappy.
He's been on the Spanner Engineering Productivity team at Google in 2018, where he’s building tooling to sustainably ensure the correctness and reliability of Spanner. He was an invited industry attendee at the 2023 Daghstul Seminar on Ensuring the Reliability and Robustness of Database Management Systems.
Prior to Google, he worked at Microsoft from 2014 to 2018 on scaling static analysis and security tooling. While there, he contributed to the SARIF standard for tooling results and spoke at BlueHat about building security tooling.
When he isn’t trying to teach computers to break software (usually other people’s), he collects fountain pens, mixes a decent manhattan, plays violin, and recently adopted a puppy.
He graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Computer Science and Mathematics in December 2013.

\textbf{Jesús Camacho Rodríguez (Principal Research SDE Manager, Gray Systems Lab)}
Jesús is a Principal Research SDE Manager at the Gray Systems Lab (GSL), the applied research group within Azure Data. His research focuses broadly on optimizing data systems performance and efficiency, with close collaboration with product and engineering teams.
Before joining Microsoft, Jesús held various engineering positions at Cloudera, where he worked on query processing and optimization in Cloudera’s SQL data warehouse engines. He has also been actively involved with open-source projects such as Apache Calcite and Apache Hive.
Jesús earned his PhD from the University of Paris-Sud and Inria, France, and holds a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Almería, Spain.

\section{Format and Planned Timeline}
