\section{Workshop Motivation and Scope}
We are running the 9th instance of the Workshop on Testing Database Systems (DBTest) at SIGMOD 2022.
After four years of absence, DBTest was successfully revived at SIGMOD 2018, with over 40 participants, 15 paper submissions (out of which 8 were accepted), and three industry sponsors (SAP, Snowflake, Undo).
Like previous instances, one of the remarkable aspects was the high number of industry participants and submissions, creating an interesting mix of both academic work and industry perspectives.
On the one hand, there was a lot of positive feedback and we were encouraged by the audience to re-establish DBTest in a yearly cadence.
On the other hand, in order to not repeat past mistakes and as announced in the 2018 workshop application, we decided to only run with a biannual cadence to prevent from running out of topics and high-quality submissions.
As a result, we applied and held the 8th instance for the DBTest workshop in 2020 in virtual format due to the pandemic with 10 submissions in total (out of which 5 were accepted as full paper and 2 were accepted as short poster papers).
We think the slightly lower number of submissions were due to the impact of the start of the pandemic on people.
Despite this we received very high quality submissions, and the workshop once again had a good mix of both academic and industry participants and presenters. In total, we had 150 registrants, and the three sessions had 72, 57, and 48 participants, respectively.
Consequentially, we decided to hold another instance of DBTest now for SIGMOD 2022.
We believe that there is the need and interest for discussing topics that are related to not only testing database management systems but also data-intensive systems in general.
Specifically, emerging new technologies such as Non-Volatile Memory impose new challenges (e.g., avoiding persistent memory leaks and partial writes), and novel system designs including FPGAs, GPUs, and RDMA call for additional attention and sophistication.
Moreover, there are new classes of data-driven applications (i.e., machine learning and big data scenarios) that need to be considered.
Another dimension includes completely new system designs---such as crowdsourcing applications, where testing imposes various monetary and functional challenges (i.e., result set quality and verification), scalable machine learning systems that combine distributed computing with modern hardware, or even cloud-based data management systems with high release cadence and extreme global reach.
Finally, there is an ever-increasing popularity and proliferation of NoSQL systems.
These systems are taking new approaches and design decisions (e.g. by replacing the traditional ACID guarantees with relaxed consistency models (BASE)) to increase performance and scalability.
Consequentially, they require special testing efforts and rigor to ensure classical database strengths such as reliability, integrity, and performance can be successfully carried over to these novel system architectures and designs.

\section{Topics of Interest}
The workshop focusses on the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing of database systems, storage services, and database applications 
    \item Testing of database systems using novel hardware and software technology (non-volatile memory, hardware transactional memory, \ldots{})
    \item Testing heterogeneous systems with hardware accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, …)
    \item Testing distributed and big data systems
    \item Testing machine learning systems
    \item Specific challenges of testing and quality assurance for cloud-based systems 
    \item War stories and lessons learned
\end{itemize}
Other topics include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance and scalability testing
    \item Testing the reliability and availability of database systems 
    \item Algorithms and techniques for automatic program verification 
    \item Maximizing code coverage during testing of database systems and applications 
    \item Generation of synthetic data for test databases 
    \item Testing the effectiveness of adaptive policies and components 
    \item Tools for analyzing database management systems (e.g., profilers, debuggers)
    \item Workload characterization with respect to performance metrics and engine components 
    \item Metrics for test quality, robustness, efficiency, and effectiveness 
    \item Operational aspects such as continuous integration and delivery pipelines
    \item Security and vulnerability testing
\end{itemize}

\section{Format and Planned Timeline}

We intend for DBTest to be held as a full-day workshop within the arrangements of SIGMOD 2022 as a hybrid event.
We have planned for the following preliminary timeline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Submissions due: March 1, 2022
    \item Notification of outcome: April 1, 2022
    \item Camera-ready due: April 17, 2022
\end{itemize}
